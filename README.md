This project is an attempt to packaging the [Ananta](https://github.com/cwt/ananta) with its runtime into a minimum, hardened docker image, while also providing a convenient way to use it.  
It is recommended to bind mount the `${HOME}/.ssh/` into the container, and the container will automatically generate `hosts.csv` based on `~/.ssh/config` for you.  
  
Since it is routine for me to spend lot of my labour hours in an air-gapped environment, a docker image seems to be the best way to package some of my favourite tools.  

## How to start

Use this tiny installer image to install a helper script of `ananta`:

```shell
curl -sSLROJ --fail -- \
    "https://github.com/IceCodeNew/anata-no-minato/releases/latest/download/ananta"

# it is always a good idea to check the content of a script before executing it
cat ./ananta

sudo install -pvD ./ananta /usr/local/bin/
rm ./ananta
```

This helper script will automatically generate hosts.csv based on `~/.ssh/config`, issue the command as below:  
(omit the hosts.csv argument)  

```shell
ananta -CS fastfetch
```

In case you want to specify an existing hosts.csv,  
   issue the command with the same arguments sequence as the original ananta command:  

```shell
ananta -t arch hosts.csv sudo pacman -Syu --noconfirm
```

## Why named "Anata No Minato"

My local disk already has too many git repositories named `docker-XXX`. Since I want to save a few keystrokes when jumping into this project directory, I won't name it `docker-ananta`.
`Ananta` doesn't align with Chinese or Japanese pronunciation conventions. By omitting one 'n' it becomes the Japanese word `Anata` (あなた), which means "you" and gives me tab completion after typing just four letters.  
Meanwhile, `Minato` (みなと) in Japanese means "harbor" - a natural association with Docker containers. When combined, these form the title of a classic Japanese enka song. Please take a listen to it ;-)
